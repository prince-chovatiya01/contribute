## Styling a component

We recommend styling components using our [design style guide](https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/).

The colors are defined in [`variable.css`](/client/src/components/layouts/variables.css), and the fonts are in [`fonts.css`](/client/src/components/layouts/fonts.css).

We are strongly opinionated about adding new variables/tokens to the colors. After careful research, the colors have been chosen to respect the freeCodeCamp brand identity, developer experience, and accessibility.

The `!important` keyword may be used to override values in some cases (e.g. accessibility concerns). You should add a comment describing the issue, so it doesn't get removed in future refactoring.

### RTL support

We are striving to support right-to-left (RTL) layout in the codebase for languages that are read in this direction. For this, you need to be mindful of how to style components. Here are some quick rules of thumb to follow:

- Don't use `float` properties
  - Use Flexbox and Grid layouts instead, as they have RTL support already built-in, and those will be easier to maintain and review.
- Don't define the direction while using `margin` and `padding`: it may seem harmless to use `padding-right` and `margin-left`, but these directions aren't mirrored when the layout changes to RTL, and adding counter values for them in the RTL file makes maintaining the codebase harder.
  - Use logical properties for them: You can add the same spacing by using `padding-inline-end` and `margin-inline-start`, and you won't need to worry about RTL layout, as they follow where the line starts and ends, and you won't need to add any extra values in the RTL files, so people wonâ€™t need to remember to change the same values in two files.
- Don't use `!important` in `font-family`: RTL layout uses different fonts compared to the LTR layout, when you add `!important` in the `font-family` property it affects the RTL layout too.

## General JavaScript

In most cases, our [linter](/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally/#follow-these-steps-to-get-your-development-environment-ready) will warn of any formatting which goes against this codebase's preferred practice.

It is encouraged to use functional components over class-based components.

## Specific TypeScript

### Migrating a JavaScript File to TypeScript

#### Retaining Git File History

Sometimes changing the file from `<filename>.js` to `<filename>.ts` (or `.tsx`) causes the original file to be deleted, and a new one created, and other times the filename just changes - in terms of Git. Ideally, we want the file history to be preserved.

The best bet at achieving this is to:

<Steps>

1. Rename the file
2. Commit with the flag `--no-verify` to prevent Husky from
   complaining about the lint errors
3. Refactor to TypeScript for migration, in a separate commit

</Steps>

:::note
Editors like VSCode are still likely to show you the file has been deleted
and a new one created. If you use the CLI to `git add .`, then VSCode will show the
file as renamed in the staging area.

### Naming Conventions

#### Interfaces and Types

For the most part, it is encouraged to use interface declarations over type declarations.

React Component Props - suffix with `Props`

```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {}
// type MyComponentProps = {};
const MyComponent = (props: MyComponentProps) => {};
